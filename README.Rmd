The **mnonr** package is a multivariate data generator which can be used to create non-normal random numbers.

The package consists of three functions: 

* __mnonr__: a function that can generate multivariate data with pre-specified multivariate skewness and kurtosis;

* __unonr__: a function that can generate multivariate data with pre-specified marginal skewness and kurtosis;

* __mardia__: a function that can check univariate and multivariate skewness and kurtosis.
