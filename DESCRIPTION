Title: A Generator of Multivariate Non-normal Random Numbers 
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Wen Qu and Zhiyong Zhang
Maintainer: Wen Qu <wqu@nd.edu>
Description: A data generator of multivariate non-normal data in R. It combines two different methods to generate non-normal data, one with user-specified multivariate skewness and kurtosis, and the other with the given marginal skewness and kurtosis. The latter one is the widely-used Vale and Maurelli's method. It also contains a function to calculate univariate and multivariate (Mardia's Test) skew and kurtosis.
